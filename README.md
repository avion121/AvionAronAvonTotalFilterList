# AvionAronAvonTotalFilterList üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to the **AvionAronAvonTotalFilterList** repository! This project automatically compiles multiple ad-blocking and privacy filter lists into a single
unified list named **AvionAronAvonTotalFilterList**. The list is updated daily and 
can be used across browsers, extensions, Android, and iOS.

## What‚Äôs Included?

This repository combines the following popular filter lists into one:

1. **Hagezi Pro** - Blocks ads, trackers, and malware.
2. **StevenBlack (Fakenews + Gambling)** - Blocks fake news and gambling sites.
3. **OISD Big List** - A huge list for blocking ads and trackers.
4. **EasyList** - The most popular list for blocking ads.
5. **EasyPrivacy** - Blocks tracking and analytics scripts.
6. **1Hosts Lite** - A lightweight blocklist for ads and trackers.

All these lists are merged into a single file called `AvionAronAvonTotalFilterList.txt`, which is updated **every day at 10:30 AM IST (5:00 AM UTC)**.

## How Does It Work?

1. Download the latest versions of the filter lists.
2. Combine them into one file.
3. Save the file in this repository.
